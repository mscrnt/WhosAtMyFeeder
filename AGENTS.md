# Repository Agent Instructions

- Always run `pytest` before committing changes to ensure tests pass.
- The tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
- No external network access is available during test runs, so tests must not rely on downloading resources.
- You can run `python agents.py` to execute the tests quickly.
